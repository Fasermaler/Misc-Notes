# 10.009 Digital World Cheat Sheet

This is a cheat sheet prepared and used by myself in the 2019 10.009 The Digital World programming module. The contents of this document were copied onto a double-sided A4 hand-written cheat sheet for use in the 2 exams and 2 tests.

## Introduction

This cheat sheet is by no means exhaustive but serves to include most of the important concepts required to allow for minimal reference to the documentation provided during the exam (of which there are: the official python documentation and the Digital World library documentation). 

This is also by no means a lesson or tutorial - the reader is expected to be familiar with the concepts to be tested. This merely tries to function as a compilation of everything of note without the reader going through the weekly assignments and pre-reading materials to get the information they need for their cheat sheet.

## General Exam / Test Tips

- Be familiar with the content to be tested 
  - Frequent need to refer to the cheat sheet wastes valuable time, heightens anxiety and displays poor mastery of the topics covered
- Copy the cheat sheet with the goal of revision in mind 
  - Do not mindlessly copy but instead seek to understand what is being written down (it will assist in memory as well)
- Attempt section B (programming questions) before Section A (short answer questions)
  - Questions in Section A can be guessed / intuited when time is lacking while you can't "guess" or "intuit" programming questions in Section B in the same manner
- Use the alternative IDEs to find out the answers to Section A
  - Some questions in Section A can be directly programmed into the alternative IDEs provided to get the answer with certainty
  - This is also made possible because Section B has been assumed to be completed (see above tip)
- In the event of Vocareum / test environment crashes:
  - Do not panic
  - Understand that everyone is in the same situation
  - Work on Section A first and if that is complete
  - Work on Section B using the alternative IDEs
- Understand that the code in Section B is graded by hand, thus it is possible to gain most of the marks despite failing 1-2 test cases
- If a dynamic programming question appears in the finals, do not worry that it cannot be completed - the majority of students are not expected to complete it.

## Cheat Sheet

Remarks may be provided below each section, they are optional and do not need to be copied.

### String Formatting

```python
# Basic Examples
print("I got {} on my DW test".format(10))			# Basic Format
print("My GPA is {0.1f}".format(5.3))				# Float Format to 3dp
print("{1} am going to {0}".format("boot-camp", "I"))	  # Tuple Format

# Padding Examples
print("Adding some padding: {:5}".format(3))    # Adding some padding:    3
print("Different padding character: {:*5}".format(3)) # Different padding character: ****3

# Alignment Examples
print("Alignment left: {0:<5}, Alignment Right: {0:>5}".format(3, 4)) # Alignment left: 3    , Alignment Right:     4
print("Alignment middle with dashes: {:-^5}".format(4)) # Alignment middle with dashes: --5--
```

#### Remarks

It is possible to directly refer to the provided Python documentation (just search `format`) and skip copying this section entirely.

### Operator Precedence 

In order of decreasing Precedence:

`()` 						Parentheses

`**`						Exponent

`*`,`/`,`//`,`%` 				Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modulus

`+`, `-`					Addition, Subtraction

`==`,`!=`,`>`,`>=`,`not in`	Comparisons, Identity, Membership Operators

`<`,`<=`,`is`,`is not`,`in`

`not`					Logical NOT

`and`					Logical AND

`or`						Logical OR

#### Remarks

Bitwise operators are omitted as they are beyond the scope of the module, they are however in the following order after addition and subtraction (just for completeness sake):

`<<`,`>>`					Bitwise Shift operators

`&` 						Bitwise AND

`^`						Bitwise XOR

`|`						Bitwise OR

### Lists and List Methods

```python
# List declaration
ls = [] 	# declare empty list

for i in range(3):
    ls.append([]) 	# make ls a list of 3 lists

# Length
len(ls) # Fetches the length of the list

# Append
ls1 = [1, 2]
ls2 = [3, 4]
ls1.append(ls2) # Appends ls2 to ls1
print(ls1) # [1, 2, [3, 4]]

# Extend
ls1 = [1, 2]
ls2 = [3, 4]
ls1.extend(ls2) # Extends ls1 with ls2 (basically combining them)
print(ls1) # [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Indexing
ls1[0] = 1 # lists start at 0
ls1[-1] = 4 # Gets the last element in the list

# Insertion
ls1.insert(0, 3) # Inserts 0 at the front of the list
print(ls1) # [3, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# Removal
ls1.remove(3) # Removes the first value of 3 it encounters
print(ls1) # [1, 2, 3, 4]
ls1.remove(0) # Returns an error

# Popping
print(ls1.pop(1)) # returns 2, popping removes the item at index given and returns it
print(ls1) # [1, 3, 4]
print(ls1.pop()) # returns 4, removes last item if no argument specified
print(ls1) # [1, 3]

# Indexing 
ls1.index(3) # returns the position of the value provided (in this case 1)

# Max and Min
max(ls1) # gets the max of the list
min(ls1) # gets the min  of the list

# Getting Max and Min Indexes (useful for a number of programs)
ls1.index(max(ls1)) # gets the max index of the list
ls1.index(min(ls1)) # gets the min index of the list

# Copying
ls3 = ls1.copy() # Returns a shallow copy of the list

# Reversing
ls1.reverse() # Reverses the list
```

#### Remarks

It is not advisable to declare using the the syntax `ls = [[0]*3]` as it makes the nested lists all refer to each other and causes undesirable behavior.

### Dictionaries and Dictionary Methods

```python
# Declaration
m_dict = {} # Creates an empty dict
f_dict = {'name':'John Doe', 'occupation':'student', 'energy_level': 0}

# Get list of items
f_dict.items() # Returns ['name', 'occupation', 'energy_level']

# Get list of values
f_dict.values() # Returns ['John Doe', 'student', 0]

# Indexing the dict
f_dict['occupation'] # Returns 'student'
```

#### Remarks

There are other dictionary methods but they are not necessary for the module.

### Object Oriented Programming

```python
# Class Declaration

class car: 		# Declares a new type of class called 'car'
    def __init__(self, make, model):	# The __init__ method is run automatically
        self.make = make 	# Assigns arguments to become internal class attributes
        self.model = model

chevy = car.(chevrolet, impala) # The arguments are parsed as per the the __ini__ func
chevy.make # Returns chevrolet
chevy.model # Returns impala
```

```python
# Magic Methods

class fuel_state:
    def __init__(self, fuel=0): # Assigns initial fuel as 0 is not specified
        self.fuel = fuel
        
    def __add__(self, other_fuel):
        temp = fuel_state()
        temp.fuel = self.fuel + other_fuel.fuel
        return temp

my_fuel = fuel_state(6)
my_fuel2 = fuel_state(8)
my_fuel3 = my_fuel1 + myfuel2 # Basically adds the fuels up and assigns them to a new fuel object
print(my_fuel3.fuel) # returns 14
```

```python
# Getter and Setter methods
# Allows for an internal variable to be obtained and set without direct public access

class temperature:
    def __init__(self):
        self.temperature = temperature # calls the temperature property
    
    def set_temperature(self, values):
        self._temperature = value
    
    def get_temperature(self):
        return self._temperature
    
    temperature = property(get_temperature, set_temperature) # defines the temperature keyword as a property that has both a getter and setter function
    
    # Basically if temperature is called without an arg, it will return self._temperature, else it will set the temperature value
```

#### Remarks

Inheritance is not covered despite it being quite an important topic for actual programming. The reader is recommended to read up on it.

```python
# Short inheritance example

class child(parent): # declare the class 'child' as a child of class 'parent'
    def __init__(self, a, b,c):
        super(parent, self).__init__(a,b,c) # initializes the values a,b and c through the parent
```

### File I/O

```python
f = open("test.txt") # sets f to be a reference to the text file "test.txt"
f = open("test.txt", 'w') # opens the file with the permissions to write into the file (default is 'r' which is read-only)

f.close() # Close the file. It is very important to close the file properly else nothing will be written properly to the file.

f.read(4) # Reads the first 4 lines

# Alternative way to open file (automatically closes the file once it exits the loop)
with open("test.txt",'w',encoding = 'utf-8') as f:
    # File operations
```

#### String Operations Pertaining to File I/O

```python
f_content = f.read(1) # read one line from the file
f_content = f_content.strip() # Strips the string of leading or trailing whitespaces
f_content = f_content.strip('#') # Strips the string of leading or trailing "#"
f_content = f_content.split() # splits a string into a list using the whitespace character
f_content = f_content.split(', ') #splits a string into a list using ', ' as the delimiter
```

#### Remarks

There are other file open modes:

`r` 			Open a file for reading (default)

`w`			Open a file for writing, creates a new file if it does not exist or truncate existing file

`x`			Open a file for exclusive creation. If the file exists, operation fails

`a`			Open a file for appending and not truncating. Creates a new file if file does not exist

`t`			Open in text mode (default)

`b`			Open in binary mode

`+`			Open a file for updating

It is also possible to specify the encoding type (highly recommended normally, but out of scope of the module):

```python
f = open("test.txt",mode = 'r',encoding = 'utf-8')
```



### State Machine

#### State Machine Diagram

![turnstile-high-res-opt](assets/turnstile-high-res-opt.jpg)

```python
from libdw import sm # Imports the SM class from the DW library

class sm_example(sm.SM):
    start_state = None # Sets the start_state to None
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.start_state = 0 # Sets the start state to 0 (usually the start case)
        
    def get_next_values(self,state, inp):
        if state == 0:		# Check the state
            if inp == 1:	# Check the input
                return 1, 5 # under a specific set of state and input, return a state and an output
```

#### Remarks

The keen-eyed reader may notice that it is nothing but a fancy wrapper around a whole bunch of if statements - and they'd be right. If one were to think in simple terms "If I am currently in x state and receive y input, I need to become in state a and output b", then each question becomes significantly simpler.

### Relevant Numpy Knowledge

```python
import numpy as np

# numpy indexing
numpy_array[row, column] 

# Slicing
new_array = array[:,3] # Gets column 3 of every row

# Obtaining array dimensions
array.shape # return (planes, rows, columns) 

# get min and max value from array
np.min(array)
np.max(array)

# get median
np.median(array)

# get percentile
np.percentile(array, 25) # First Quartile
np.percentile(array, 75) # Third Quartile
```

#### Remarks

Numpy is an incredibly powerful tool written in C++ and allows python scripts more flexibility and capability than they otherwise might have. It is highly recommended that the reader acquaint themselves with numpy. Recommended reading: [Numpy Cheat sheet by methylDragon](<https://github.com/methylDragon/python-data-tools-reference/blob/master/Numpy/01%20Numpy%20Basics.md> ).

### Linear Regression and kNN classification

No I'm not going to call it 'machine learning' because if I do then I could call if-statements Artificial Intelligence.

#### Confusion Matrix

|                      | Predicted Negatives  | Predicted Postives   |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Actual Negatives** | True Negatives (TN)  | False Positives (FP) |
| **Actual Positives** | False Negatives (FN) | True Positives (TP)  |

- Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)
- Accuracy = (TP + TN) / Total
- False Positive Rate = FP / (FP + TN)

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Generates a c_matrix as above
c_matrix = confusion_matrix(actual_targets, predicted_targets, labels) 
```

#### Five-Number Summary

Consists of:

- Minimum
- First Quartile
- Median
- Third Quartile
- Maximum

```python
# Full code from CS2
def five_number_summary(x):
    ls = []
    if len(x.shape) != 2:
        return None
    
    num_cols = x.shape[1]
    for col in range(num_cols):
        m_dict = {'minimum':0, 'first quartile':0, 'median':0, 'third quartile': 0, 'maximum':0}
        data_col = x[:,col]
        m_dict['maximum'] = np.max(data_col)
        m_dict['minimum'] = np.min(data_col)
        m_dict['median'] = np.median(data_col)
        m_dict['first quartile'] = np.percentile(data_col,25)
        m_dict['third quartile'] = np.percentile(data_col,75)
        ls.append(m_dict)
        
    return ls
```

#### Normalization

```python
# Full Code from CS3

import numpy as np

def normalize_minmax(data):
    if len(data.shape) != 2:
        return None
    
    max_vals = np.max(data,axis=0)
    min_vals = np.min(data,axis=0)
    
    n_cols = data.shape[1]
    for col in range(n_cols):
        data[:,col] = (data[:,col] - min_vals[col])/(max_vals[col] - min_vals[col])
    return data
```

#### k Nearest Neighbors Classification

```python
def knn_classifier(bunchobject, feature_list, size, seed , k ): 
    
    # Data wrangling
    data = bunchobject.data[:, feature_list]
    target = bunchobject.target
    data_norm = normalize_minmax(data)
    
    # Splits the dataset 
    data_train, data_test, target_train, target_test = train_test_split(data_norm, target, test_size=size, random_state = seed) 
    
    clf = neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier(k) # define the classifier object
    clf.fit(data_train, target_train) # train the classifier on the train data
    target_predict = clf.predict(data_test) # test the classifier on test data
    results = get_metrics(target_test, target_predict, [1,0]) # get the metrics of the test
    return(results)
```

#### Linear Regression

```python
def linear_regression(bunchobject, x_index, y_index, size, seed):
    # gets the X and Y data and assign them 
    x = bunchobject.data[:,[x_index]]
    y = bunchobject.data[:,[y_index]]
    
    # Splits the dataset 
    x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size = size, random_state = seed)
    
    # Creates the regression object
    regr = linear_model.LinearRegression()
    regr.fit(x_train, y_train) # create a best fit line
    y_pred = regr.predict(x_test) # test the best fit line on test data
    
    coeff = regr.coef_ # Get the gradient
    intercept = regr.intercept_ 
    meansqerror = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred) # do an RMSE calculation
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
    
    results = {"coefficients":coeff, "intercept": intercept, "mean squared error": meansqerror, "r2 score": r2}
    
    
    return x_train, y_train, x_test, y_pred, results
```

#### Remarks

Do not expect the programming part of this section to be tested. This can be shown by the lack of homework for this particular topic. The example code is only here in the event that the reader would like to copy it wholesale. My advice is to focus on understanding the concept more than the full code snippets.

## Extra Material

Useful things not covered in the module or just some tricks I personally use to get things done quickly.

### Try, Except

A try, except allows the program to continue running after a bit of code throws an exception (useful for questions that require divide by zero checks and etc). While it may be frowned upon for it to be incorporated as part of code logic, all bets are off during an exam when the code needs tp be functional within a short period of time.

**Syntax**

```python
try:
    # Code that will attempt to run
    # Code will run line by line until it runs into a piece of code that throws an 		exception
    
except:
    # Code that runs when an exception is thrown during the "try" loop
```

**Example Usage**

```python
# The following code tries to get the length of the input list, but returns None if a list is not provided:

def check_len(ls):
    try:
        return (len(ls)) # Tries to return the length of the list
    except:
        return None # Returns None when using len() on the input throws an exception
```

Try, finally is also used for file I/O to ensure that the file is always written despite any exceptions that may be raised in the program:

```python
try:
   f = open("test.txt",encoding = 'utf-8')
   # perform file operations
finally:
   f.close()
```



### String Reversal

Just a quick piece of code to reverse a string.

**Syntax**

```python
reversed_string = string[::-1]
```

**Example Use**

```python
# This code was part of my original submission for CS3 - Palindrome Number
# Before it was modified because there was an added requirement to use loops

# The code checks if a number is a palindrome

def is_palindrome(num):
    
    numstr = str(num) # changes the number to a string
    numstr2 = numstr[::-1] # creates the reverse of itself
    
    if numstr == numstr2:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Easy File Reading

The following code works on any sort of text file reading and has serviced me for months without fail. In the context of this module, it will function more than adequately for any file reading assignment.

**Syntax**

```python
f_content = [i.strip().split() for i in f.readlines()]
```

It uses list comprehensions (which is not recommended for use in exams due to the likelihood of messing it up and wasting time) - feel free to search up what list comprehensions are specifically.

This code will return a list of lists:

```python
# Example text file:
I am very
sad that
vocareum    crashed
     again

# Actual code
# In most cases the test case in Vocareum will give "f" as the file needed to be read,  thus only the function has to be coded for

def get_content(f)
	f_content = [i.strip().split() for i in f.readlines()]
	print(f_content)
    
# This will print:
[['I', 'am', 'very'], ['sad', 'that'], ['vocareum', 'crashed'], ['again']]
```
