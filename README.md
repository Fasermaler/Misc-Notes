## Coding Notes / Miscellaneous Documentation

Just a collection of random notes because I tend to forget things.

------

If you like my stuff, I would humbly ask you to drop a star. 

Thank you! 

## Author's Note

I'm unlikely to ever fully cover basics such as C++, Java and etc because I feel that other sites and resources cover them better. For instance, [Learn C++](https://www.learncpp.com/) is an excellent site for learning C++ and any attempts by myself to document it would be extremely lengthy and would not do it any justice. If you'd like a python reference, the [Digital World Python Cheatsheet](https://github.com/Fasermaler/coding-notes/blob/master/Digital%20World%20Python%20Cheat%20Sheet/10.009%20Digital%20World%20Cheat%20Sheet.md) might serve as such.

Some documentation might just be notes and troubleshooting methods that I have had to use in the past when dealing with frameworks and thus might not be beginner-centric.

Additional resources to learn these things and more can be found in [Additional Materials and Resources](#mats)

## Additional Materials <a name="mats"></a> 

[go to top](#top)

- C
  - [Book: Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3rd/dp/013409266X)
    - Essential reading for any programmer as it touches on how computer systems actually work and how software can be made more efficient or robust by knowing the underlying systems (software or hardware)
  - [Book: Programming in ANSI C](https://www.amazon.in/Programming-ANSI-C-Balagurusamy/dp/933921966X)
    - Excellent no-frill reference that goes into great detail into the basics as well as intricacies of programming in C.

- C++
  -  [Website: Learn C++](https://www.learncpp.com/) 
    - Thorough step-by-step, topical walk-through of all the major components of C++ programming. Also has lots of pointers for good practices when writing code
  - [Website: Codecademy C++](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus)
    - Interactive online course to get you started immediately on C++ basics. The good part is that it reduces the initial barrier towards learning C++ as it runs directly on browser.

- Python
  - [Book: Learn Python the Hard Way](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914)
    - Learn python the hard way is an excellent book that puts the reader through a myriad of exercises to learn and write python code properly, instilling good coding practices early.
  - [Website: Codecademy Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)
    - Usually the go-to course for anyone trying to pick up python for the first time. It allows you to get right into the basics in your browser - no frills.

- OpenCV - Python
  - [pyimagesearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/)
    - Great all around reference with plenty of example code and use cases
    - Has an email openCV course that is actually not garbage

- Keras
  - [Book: Deep Learning with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Python-Francois-Chollet/dp/1617294438)
    - This book is literally written by the creator of Keras. It is a (relatively) fast read that goes through Keras functionality through examples as well as explaining Deep Learning concepts from the ground up.

## Useful Repositories

- [rlcode](https://github.com/rlcode)
  - Lots of repositories on reinforcement learning and DQNs
  - Plenty of minimal code that can serve as building blocks
  - This person basically lives, breathes and eats reinforcement learning
- [TheAlgorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/)
  - Lots of implementations for many many different types of algorithms in all languages
  - A good reference
- [AtsushiSakai's Python Robotics](https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics)
  - Huge repository of Python implementations of well known robotics algorithms
  - Includes visualizations as well
